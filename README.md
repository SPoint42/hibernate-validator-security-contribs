# Hibernate Validator Security Contribs

## Description
This project aims at providing a set of content-checking constraint annotations, 
focused on security, using the JSR303 RI Hibernate Validation. 
(http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/validator.html).

This JSR can be used to perform security check on input user data and then it's for this 
reason that i decided to use it as framework.

This project is implemented using Maven (v3.x) structure.
